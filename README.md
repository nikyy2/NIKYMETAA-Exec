## Background
Originally, this project was a maintained private and unfinished build of *Incognito*, yes you can call this project "(OLD) Incognito" or whatever you want to call.

However, following a public leak of the *Incognito 1.1.6 dev Source", the source is most likely won't work without changing offsets, fixing bridge, and a bit of modify in injection method so i fixed all of the problems and wanting to release it for anyone wanting to use.
